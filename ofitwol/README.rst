OFITWOL
=======

This directory contains some central files, a set of programs useful
for developing OFITWOL lexicons and subdirectroies for making FST
analyzers and guessers to be used e.g. with hfst-lookup.

The subdirectory **./ofi2** contains all necessary files for building an
analyser FST and a guesser FST for Finnish.  The the files which are
directly in this directory are **less interesting and they do not form
a complete and a consistent sets**.  The same applies to the directories
./analys, ./guess and ./klk where the contents might dependent on some
data not present in this repository (being possibly non-free).

In brief: **Use only the files in the ./ofi2 directory** and ignore
all other subdirectories and files unless you are interested in the
history how the current ofitwol evolved into what it presently is.
