# ofitwol
Open Finnish Two-Level morphological analyzer based on the HFST finite-state transducer tools.

See https://pytwolc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ofitwol.html for more information on the goals and plans for this project.

See https://github.com/hfst/hfst for more information on the HFST Helsinki Finite-State Transducer tools such as hfst-twolc, hfst-lexc, etc. 

Ofitwol is related to OMORFI (by Tommi Pirinen et al.) an open Finnish morphological analyzer based on the HFST tools, although OFITWOL and OMORFI share no rules, lexicon or code.  See https://github.com/flammie/omorfi for more information on OMORFI.

For some information on installing OFITWOL itself see the wiki page https://github.com/koskenni/ofitwol/wiki but most of the dicumentation of OFITWOL will appear in READTHEDOCS.

OFITWOL is in the development stages but one may well experiment with it.
